## Objectives
- Implement a Web Calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

## Thoughts and Future Improvements
- This was a simple yet challenging project of learning to work with flex and grid in CSS. You really had to think about data storage and manipulation. 
- Have a history of calculations instead of just last calculation
- Include trig functions such as (sin, cos, tan)
- Include more functions of a scientific calculator
